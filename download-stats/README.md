# Part one: simulate some download statistics for journals

In this part, we will make_data.R

# Part two: analyse the download statistics for journals

Now that we have some simulated data, let's analyse it.

1. Draw a graph to plot the total number of downloads per month; can
   you see the effects we built in.
2. Can you predict which are the "prestige" journals, without knowing
   their names?
3. Which are the top 10 journals by stats?  Bottom 10? 
4. Plot the distribution of downloads by journal.


# Exercises/extensions

1. Assign each journal to a publisher.
2. Assign cost to each journal, and have a budget.  what is best way
   to spend your budget if you can't afford to get everything?
3. Add your own journal titles, or vary how download statistics are generated.
