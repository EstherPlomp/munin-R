# munin-R

Welcome to the home page of the Munin "introduction to R" workshop.  Please watch this introductory video to explain what is happening.

# Course materials before the workshop

In preparation for the workshop, we recommend that you learn R.  To help with this, we have provided some lecture notes, and accompanying videos.
You can check the course notes now, and if you get a place on the workshop, we will give you access to the videos.  

We suggest that you will need to devote about 16 hours (4 hours/week) to work through the slides and try some examples for yourself.  We will have weekly catch-up sessions when you can join the course hosts on a Zoom session to ask us questions about the material, or give other feedback.


# Workshop

At the workshop, we plan to work through some case studies of applications of R, particularly geared to those of interest in the 
scholarly communications community.  

## Format of the day

We will meet over zoom 10-3pm (Norway time) (9-2pm GMT); we will have a morning session (10-11:30) and afternoon session (1:30-3pm).  During the lunch time break, we will keep the zoom session open to allow participants to informally ask questions and discuss.
