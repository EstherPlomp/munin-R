# munin-R

Welcome to the home page of the Munin "introduction to R" workshop.

# Course materials before the workshop

In preparation for the workshop, we recommend that you learn some R.
To help with this, we have provided some [lecture
notes](https://github.com/lgatto/spr/blob/master/2020/spr-revised.pdf),
and accompanying videos.  You can check the course notes now, and if
you get accepted onto the workshop, we will give you access to the
videos.

We suggest that you will need to devote about 16 hours (4 hours/week)
to work through the slides and try some examples for yourself.  We
will have weekly [drop-in sessions](#drop-in-sessions) when you can 
join the course organisers on a Zoom session to ask us questions about
the material, or discuss potential case studies.

You won't need to learn R in its entirety (and you can ignore the
slides marked "Advanced") but with a bit of background, you will get
more out of the workshop.

# Workshop


## Case studies

At the workshop, we will work through two case studies that should be
of broad interest to the scholarly comms world.

1. Simulating and analysing journal download statistics.
2. Interfacing with ORCID (and possibly CRISTIN) using R.

To encourage discussion amongst the participants, we expect to limit
the workshop to about 20 people.  We will not be recording the session.

## Format of the workshop

On 17th November, We will meet over zoom 10-3pm (CET); we will have a
morning session (10-11:30) and afternoon session (1:30-3pm).  During
the lunch time break, we will keep the zoom session open to allow
participants to informally ask questions and discuss.

## Drop-in sessions

Three drop-in sessions were held on Monday lunchtimes.  These have now finished.

- Room one: https://meet.jit.si/munin-R-1
- Room two: https://meet.jit.si/munin-R-2

See the [privacy policy](https://jitsi.org/meet-jit-si-privacy/) and 
[Terms of Service](https://jitsi.org/meet-jit-si-terms-of-service/) for 
meet.jit.si.

If you have a concrete question with R, it would be helpful if you create
a [minimal reproducible 
example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
that is only a few lines of code.

## Participant chat

If you want to discuss amongst yourself, feel free to join the
following Gitter chat room:

Note that you need a GitHub, GitLab, or Twitter account to join and 
that the chat room is public. You may create an anonymous account on one
of these platforms if you prefer not to disclose your name.
Please see the [Gitter.im Terms of 
Service](https://element.io/terms-of-service).

## Preparation

Before the day of the workshop, it would be helpful, although not
essential, if you note:

1. [Register](https://orcid.org/register) for an ORCID account if
   you don't already have one.  Ensure you can login to orcid.
2. You may wish to bring along a CSV of ORCID entries of a few researchers
   in your institution that you wish to analyse.
3. We plan to use some external R packages.  Installing them may save
   you some time on the day -- see [rorcid/install.R](rorcid/install.R).
