# munin-R

Welcome to the home page of the Munin "introduction to R" workshop.
Please watch this [introductory video](...) to explain what is happening.

# Course materials before the workshop

In preparation for the workshop, we recommend that you learn R.  To
help with this, we have provided some [lecture
notes](https://github.com/lgatto/spr/blob/master/2020/spr-revised.pdf),
and accompanying videos.  You can check the course notes now, and if
you get a place on the workshop, we will give you access to the
videos.

We suggest that you will need to devote about 16 hours (4 hours/week)
to work through the slides and try some examples for yourself.  We
will have weekly catch-up sessions (beginning October 26th) when you
can join the course hosts on a Zoom session to ask us questions about
the material, or give other feedback.

# Workshop

At the workshop, we plan to work through some case studies of
applications of R, particularly geared to those of interest in the
scholarly communications community.  These case studies have not yet
been prepared (as of October 15th 2020), so we are looking for suggestions
from your on what types of problems you would like us to discuss.  We
hope to do at least two case studies in detail.  To help seed the
conversation, here are some potential topics:

1. Text mining of journal articles.
2. Working with resources like orcid via R, e.g. https://ropensci.org/packages/literature/
3. Examining possibilities with https://ropensci.org/
4. Moving away from spreadsheets and into programming.
5. Reproducible research documents.

To encourage discussion amongst the participants, we expect to limit
the workshop to about 20 people.  We will not be recording the session.

## Format of the day

We will meet over zoom 10-3pm (CET) (9-2pm GMT); we will have
a morning session (10-11:30) and afternoon session (1:30-3pm).  During
the lunch time break, we will keep the zoom session open to allow
participants to informally ask questions and discuss.
